# Beyond-typologies-beyond-optimization

This repository is the outcome of a research collaboration between the Chair of Digital Architectonics and the Chair of Structural Design at ETH Zurich. It was developed by Karla Saldana Ochoa, Patrick Ole Ohlbrock, Pierluigi D'Acunto, and Vahid Moosavi.

This work aims to navigate the enormous space of computer-generated forms, based on subjective (designer) and objective (machine) criteria. Hence, this approach surpasses a pure optimization in which only quantifiable measures are taken into account through a prototypical implementation of a computer-aided workflow in which the designer and the machine coexist and potentially yield in a process in which both can unfold their strengths. In particular, the machine is used to optimize a given task and guide and support designers in the quest for innovative and appropriate solutions for structural concepts and design tasks.   In the present work, Machine intelligence in the form of three algorithms (Generation of Equilibrium Forms; Combinatorial Equilibrium Modelling (CEM), Clustering; Self Organizing Map (SOM), and Classification; Gradient Boosting Trees) are combined with the ability of humans to evaluate non-quantifiable aspects in a discursive manner. 
More specifically, a cyclic, fifth-stage workflow (generation, clustering, evaluation, selection, and regeneration)exemplifies the interaction between machine and human intelligence. Through this repeated interaction, the machine can learn the non-linear correlation of forms and their properties and generate candidates itself. A stadium roof is used as a case study to test the proposed approach. This test indicates that it is possible to combine the strengths of human and machine intelligence already in the conceptual generative design phase. 

The repository makes use of built-in functions within the software Wolfram Mathematica (https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/, accessed 04/2020).
